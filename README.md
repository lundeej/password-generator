# password-generator

# Description: 
This password generator gives you the option to input you desired password length, if you would like to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters in the password. Once all the desired values are inputted it generated random characters based on your desired values. 

Some techinques used in this code are: 
- methods
- scope 
- object methods 
- functions 
- iteration 
- arrays 
- variables 
- conditional statments 

Some of the challenged I faced while making this application was how to have the variables selected saved into the array for the password to be generated. As well as how to create the iteration to have it ran to the desired length. 

# How to Use: 
1) Click Generate Password 
2) Input your desired length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)
3) Click 'OK' if you would like to include 
- Uppercase
- Lowecase
- Numbers 
- Special Characters 
when prompted to the question. 
4) A Password will generated
